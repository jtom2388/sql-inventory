1) Calculate total number of units SHIPPED overall
2) For each range of time, calculate the total available inventory IN WAREHOUSE beyond that range
3) Compare available inventory beyond specified time range to total units shipped overall
    a) If available inventory is greater than total units shipped, then number of available units in that range remain the same
    b) Otherwise, deduct the difference (shipped units - available units beyond range) from available inventory for specified range
    c) If difference is greater than number of available units, then output 0
